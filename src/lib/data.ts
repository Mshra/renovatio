      "In the bustling heart of Delhi, the Sharma family, known for their punctuality, dreamed of turning their 2500 sqm home into a peaceful retreat, where simplicity meets elegance. They wanted neutral colors and lots of natural light from the north-facing windows. We carefully planned each room to flow smoothly into the next, making sure every corner felt connected and calm. From the cozy bedrooms with soft fabrics to the modern kitchen and welcoming living room, every space felt harmonious. Big windows framed beautiful views of the bustling city streets, and the seamless flooring made the whole house feel bright and open. Even the bathrooms and puja room were designed with care, using soft colors to create a sense of peace. In the end, the Sharma residence became a testament to the power of thoughtful design, inviting everyone to experience serenity and balance amidst the busy city life of Delhi.",

    description:
      "Explore the Vashist family's journey in converting their vibrant city dwelling into a tranquil oasis where simplicity harmonizes with sophistication amid the lively streets of Delhi. Perched in the heart of Delhi, this intimate 1000 sq m residence serves as a sanctuary for a dynamic family. What sets it apart? Well, to begin, we opted to retain the majestic tree in front. Sure, we could have removed it, but why? That tree functions as a shield, muffling the clamor of traffic. Moreover, its luxuriant foliage affords us a degree of seclusion from the urban commotion. Thus, when you're unwinding on the upper floors, you're not subjected to the sight of cars whizzing past—thank you, tree! Indoors, the focus is on ensuring that each space exudes a sense of coziness and refinement. From the walk-in closets to the snug corners, every element is customized for the inhabitants. Additionally, with copious amounts of natural light streaming in, it feels akin to bringing the outdoors inside. Therefore, if you seek a residence where nature and luxury seamlessly intertwine, you've discovered it. Welcome to your new abode, where the tree outside is not merely a tree—it's an integral member of the family.",
